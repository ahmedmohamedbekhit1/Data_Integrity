# Data Integrity Tasks Repository

## 📌 Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring **Data Integrity** through a series of tasks. Each task will focus on a different aspect of ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and security. The tasks will include implementations of security mechanisms, cryptographic techniques, and integrity verification methods.

## 📂 Tasks
Each task will contain:
- A detailed explanation of the data integrity concept being addressed.
- A practical implementation using code (Python, Node.js, or other relevant technologies).
- Instructions on how to set up and use the implementation.
- A test suite to verify the effectiveness of the solution.

## 📜 Progress
```
Task 1: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) API ✅
Task 2: Coming Soon ⏳
```

### ✅ Task 1: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) API
Enhancing authentication security by implementing an additional verification step.

Each task will have its own sub-folder containing a README with setup instructions, code implementation, and testing guidelines.
